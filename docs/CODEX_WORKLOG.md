# Codex worklog

## 2026-10-02T23:32:06+06:00 — Local Codex routing profiles

- Task: configured requested researcher lead/worker/mechanical workflow; no experimental runs.
- Created: `/Users/shazzad/.codex/lead.config.toml`, `worker.config.toml`, `mechanical.config.toml`; repository `scripts/codex-lead`, `scripts/codex-worker`, `scripts/codex-mechanical`, `scripts/check_codex_profiles.sh`, `docs/CODEX_PROFILES.md`, and this worklog.
- Existing files modified: none. Backups: none needed; all destinations were new and installation refused existing files/symlinks.
- Commands/checks: CLI version/help and protocol-schema inspection; local `config/read` layer inspection; strict saved-file parsing through isolated local app-server configuration reads; `codex --profile <name> sandbox /usr/bin/true` for all profiles; `bash -n` on all scripts; verification utility; mock launcher tests from another directory; AGENTS.md SHA-256 comparison; targeted forbidden-settings scan.
- Findings: Codex `0.159.0-alpha.12.1`, CODEX_HOME unset so `/Users/shazzad/.codex` used. Every requested key is supported unchanged. Lead Sol Medium, Luna Low default, limit 3; Worker Luna Medium; Mechanical Luna Low; worker agents disabled. All use low verbosity, disabled web search, workspace-write, on-request. No service tier selected. No project configuration or precedence conflict found; existing untrusted parent trust preserved.
- Validation: all requested profile values, strict parser checks, named-profile CLI loading, executable bits, launcher root/argument forwarding, and unchanged AGENTS.md passed. No model turn, internet access, authentication change, package/model installation, or research configuration change.
- Validation limitation: app-server does not accept --profile in this version; strict checks used physical copies of each profile as a temporary config.toml. Named-profile acceptance was separately verified by sandbox commands. Actual model/delegated-agent execution was not tested.
- Unresolved/manual action: user must add delegation policy to AGENTS.md. Launch a fresh CLI session to apply a profile; desktop restart unnecessary for launchers. No scientific decision was made and no researcher validation of research conclusions is required for this configuration-only task.

## 2026-10-02 — Repository audit and pilot workspace bootstrap

- Task: audited the current checkout and prepared the minimum pilot directory structure; no scenario selected and no experimental run performed.
- Created directories: `private/ground_truth/`, `private/original_snapshots/`, `pilot/conditions/E1/`, `pilot/conditions/E2/`, `pilot/conditions/E3/`, `config/`, `prompts/`, `tests/`, `logs/raw/`, `logs/normalized/`, `results/` (existing `scripts/` and `docs/` retained).
- Created files: `docs/environment_inventory.md`, `config/harness_commands.example.sh`.
- Modified files: `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md` only. Existing benchmark files were not present or modified.
- Commands/checks: read `AGENTS.md`, `SESSIONS.md`, existing research notes and profile scripts; enumerated repository files and directories; checked command paths and versions (`qwen --version`, `opencode --version`, `ollama --version`, `python3 --version`, `uname -a`, `sw_vers`); checked local Ollama `/api/version` and `/api/tags` endpoints; searched for RepoPairBench, smoke-test and harness invocation references. `git status` could not be used because this workspace is not a Git repository.
- Findings: macOS 15.8 / arm64; Qwen Code 0.24.6; OpenCode 1.18.30; Ollama client 0.32.14; Python 3.14.7. Ollama server is unreachable, so installed model status cannot be confirmed. RepoPairBench data, smoke tests/logs, and exact known-good harness invocations are absent from the checkout. Context length 16384 is recorded for future process use; no model call was made.
- Unresolved issues: make Ollama endpoint reachable to verify server and installed model; identify/provide RepoPairBench path; recover exact harness invocations or separately authorize a future smoke test. No researcher decision or validation was made or is required for this bootstrap task.

## 2026-10-02 — Follow-up inventory after data arrival

- Task: rechecked RepoPairBench paths and Ollama reachability after researcher update; no harnesses launched and no configuration changed.
- Files modified: `docs/environment_inventory.md`.
- Commands/checks: `rg --files --hidden -g '!.git'`; targeted `find` for RepoPairBench; `ollama --version`; local Ollama `/api/version` and `/api/tags` requests.
- Findings: dataset files now present at `data/repopairbench/repopairbench_100.jsonl` and `data/repopairbench/repopairbench_100_manifest.json`. Researcher confirmed smoke-test logs are unnecessary. Ollama remains unreachable from this environment (connection refused); model installation is still unverified.
- Unresolved issues: Ollama server reachability/model tag confirmation. Exact harness invocation remains undocumented; no speculative command added. No scenario selection or researcher validation performed.

## 2026-10-02 — Record researcher-provided Ollama verification

- Task: updated environment documentation from terminal output supplied by the researcher.
- Files modified: `docs/environment_inventory.md`, `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md`.
- Commands/tests: no new host-local command could be run from the Codex runner; recorded the supplied `curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/version` and `ollama list` results.
- Findings: researcher-provided output confirms Ollama server version 0.32.14 and installed `qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M` (ID `6488c96fa5fa`, 6.6 GB); `qwen3.5:9b-mlx` is also listed. The Codex command runner itself remains unable to reach `127.0.0.1:11434`, so the network/environment boundary remains unresolved.
- Unresolved issues: determine the approved host/network context for future harness invocations if the runner cannot access host Ollama. Exact Qwen Code/OpenCode run invocations remain undocumented. No experimental run or model request was performed, and no researcher scientific decision is pending for this inventory update.

## 2026-10-03T00:11:45+06:00 — Session 2: RepoPairBench candidate shortlist

- Task: screened 100 Python-tagged local function-pair records, inspected the linked upstream schema/reconstruction instructions, reconstructed seven first-parent/fixing-commit source pairs, and prepared a four-candidate provisional shortlist. Stopped before scenario selection and condition construction.
- Created: `docs/candidate_shortlist.md`; `docs/candidate_files/{24e78349,7c167feb,d2b7d775,ee76e0c9}.txt`; researcher-only `private/original_snapshots/session2/` containing seven ID directories, each with two commit-addressed source archives, two regular-file trees, GitHub commit response and `acquisition.json`; `source_file_hashes.json`, `acquire_initial.py`, and `acquire_replacements.py`. Temporary acquisition/authoring snippets were also used under `/tmp/`.
- Modified existing files: `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md` only. Neither source benchmark file, downloaded source file, configuration nor raw log was modified.
- Commands/checks: read AGENTS.md, Session 2 instructions, environment inventory/worklog and harness placeholders; JSON metadata enumeration; fetched supplied DATASET.md and linked clone/pair-builder instructions; Python urllib GitHub commit resolution and commit-addressed archive acquisition (network escalation authorized by automatic review); traversal rejection assertions; regular-file-only exclusive extraction with symlinks never materialized; SHA-256 archive/source inventories; targeted `rg`, numbered-source reads and paired source diffs; verified all 14 dataset target snippets after whitespace normalization; checked 17 requested fields per candidate and existence of every navigation-report path; scanned reports for CVE/CWE/GHSA/source-body leakage; rechecked both benchmark SHA-256 values and all downloaded source-file hashes; confirmed empty condition/log trees. Checked retained snippets with `--help` only; no repository code or experimental agents executed.
- Delegation: two bounded Luna Low read-only workers collected Scout/Kiwi data-flow paths and targeted leakage/route locations; lead inspected key vulnerable source excerpts and integrated findings. Workers made no scientific selection.
- Important findings: shortlist is iRedAdmin, Kiwi TCMS, Piccolo and OctoPrint. iRedAdmin has the clearest engineering boundary across source files; three others require excerpt-based E3 workspaces to hide co-located dependencies. Piccolo has substantial target-only sufficiency risk. Excluded inspected Gradio (unresolved secure_filename definition/import), Invenio (external authorization semantics and permissive local policy), and Scout (harmful download interpretation not established from inspected source). Snapshot link omissions are disclosed in acquisition manifests; original archives retain them. Fix API metadata contains messages/patches and must remain researcher-only.
- Unresolved issues: no complete alternative-evidence/leakage audit, runtime exploit, timing test or scientific condition validation was performed. Source-level reachability, external-library semantics, target-only sufficiency and permissible excerpt boundaries require validation. Previous host/Ollama reachability and exact harness invocation issues were not advanced in this session.
- Researcher decisions still required: manually choose ONE scenario, validate its vulnerability and candidate decisive evidence, establish genuine E2 insufficiency/E3 unavailability, and approve any excerpt-based construction. All interpretations are marked REQUIRES RESEARCHER VALIDATION. No next research stage started.

## 2026-10-03T16:25:14+06:00 — Researcher validation follow-up before condition building

- Task: prepared a concrete source-grounded decision packet recommending iRedAdmin 24e78349 for researcher acceptance; no final scenario decision recorded.
- Created: `docs/scenario_validation.md`; `private/ground_truth/24e78349_validation/probe_data_flow.py`; `private/ground_truth/24e78349_validation/data_flow_result.json`.
- Modified existing files: `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md` only; existing shortlist and source snapshots preserved.
- Commands/tests: reread AGENTS.md and shortlist; read renderer, target, decorator, DB filtering, validators, template and parent layout; source-wide rg for alternate sinks/renderers/settings/leakage; one bounded Luna Low read-only inventory worker with lead review; checked host/bundled Python for Jinja (absent; no installation); executed reviewed source function units with synthetic request/session/SQL fixtures; compared vulnerable/fixed render arguments; tested non-global-admin denial; tested output overwrite/path-boundary rejection; checked script syntax/help/result schema; SHA-256 rechecked all fourteen acquired source trees and both benchmark files; confirmed empty conditions and experiment logs. No public internet, full application, HTML rendering, browser, experimental harness or model run.
- Findings: actual list_logs validates DB filters without replacing caller render values. Vulnerable GET passes marker values unchanged; fixed GET validates them away; both decorators deny lower-privilege fixture. Exact sink is unescaped hidden attributes in template; no duplicate exact sink found outside templates/. Renderer is custom Jinja Environment with no autoescape option. Historical dependencies are not pinned.
- Limitations: probe demonstrates data flow only, not Jinja/browser exploitability; synthetic successful backend fixtures do not verify a deployed database or reachability. Source conclusion depends on normal Jinja defaults and default skin. E2 insufficiency/E3 unavailability remain proposed until actual workspace audit; model memorization and generic inference remain confounds.
- Researcher decisions required: select iRedAdmin or another candidate; accept source-level assessment scope with explicit global-admin requirement; accept whole-file E3 omission proposal subject to later audit. No ground truth established automatically and no condition construction started.

## 2026-10-03T16:29:42+06:00 — Researcher acceptance of scenario 24e78349

- Task: recorded explicit researcher approval of iRedAdmin 24e78349, target controllers/panel/log.py:Log.GET, for the single-scenario pilot.
- Created files: none. Modified: docs/scenario_validation.md; docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md.
- Commands/checks: updated pending status from the researcher response; checked selected ID and accepted scope in the validation document. No benchmark changes, condition construction, or experimental runs.
- Accepted scope: source-grounded reflected-XSS assessment under normal Jinja defaults; global-administrator requirement explicit; browser/deployed exploitability remains untested. Whole-file E3 omission of templates/ and libs/iredbase.py approved with target preserved, subject to later workspace audit.
- Remaining researcher validation: actual E2/E3 evidence sufficiency/unavailability and leakage/isolation audit after construction. No runtime claim or condition-validity certification inferred from approval.

## 2026-10-03T16:40:46+06:00 — Session 3: selected scenario 24e78349 validation dossier

- Task: validated local provenance and compared the researcher-selected iRedAdmin pair; prepared the requested 15-section dossier and machine-readable scenario-card template without substituting the scenario or finalizing ground truth. Prior researcher selection/scope acceptance preserved.
- Created: `config/scenario.json`; researcher-only `private/ground_truth/24e78349_validation/session2_approved_decision_packet.md`, `session3_security_change.diff`, `session3_pair_audit.json`.
- Modified: `docs/scenario_validation.md` (rewritten as requested Session 3 dossier); `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md` (this append). Existing decision packet backed up before rewriting; prior probe/results, dataset, snapshots, configuration and logs retained.
- Commands/checks: read AGENTS.md, session instructions, existing dossier/shortlist/provenance and prior probe; quick memory pass for staged-work boundaries; two bounded read-only workers (Luna Low pair inventory; Luna Medium multi-file alternative-evidence search) with lead inspection of critical excerpts; numbered source reads and rg over target/routes/helpers/types/configuration/template ancestry/macros/assets/error handlers/security hints; deterministic whole-pair SHA-256 comparison and exact unified diff; JSON schema/TODO/path/line checks; exact 15-section heading check; AST target range check; archive/first-parent provenance checks; prior probe input-hash revalidation without rerunning; both benchmark hashes and all 7,744 previously inventoried source files rechecked unchanged; empty conditions/raw and normalized logs confirmed; no evidence manifest/condition builder created.
- Important findings: exactly controller and log template differ, with caller-side input validation plus explicit attribute escaping in the fixed tree. Candidate decisive facts are present in vulnerable source. Target alone does not reveal actual renderer/template behavior. Pagination's show_pages macro escapes baseurl/sep, and msg error macro escapes its normal input; these are not equivalent unescaped sinks. No concrete duplicate target sink found outside templates/. SameSite=Strict cookie configuration qualifies any claim about cross-site authenticated delivery.
- Scientific limits: local static review and previously recorded fixture-based data-flow probe only; no Jinja/browser/full-application exploit, model or experimental run. Jinja remains unpinned; default-skin/library semantics and already-authorized-request assumptions explicit. Removing a single helper/file is not certified to make E3 unresolved; entire templates/ plus libs/iredbase.py remains a proposed boundary subject to final allowlist/access audit.
- Researcher decisions still required: approve Session 3 card, fill validated_label/vulnerability_class/decisive_evidence_description, approve final decisive paths and sufficiency threshold, resolve realistic delivery scope and shared neutral cookie/session context, and approve later evidence inclusion/exclusion decisions. Scientific final fields remain RESEARCHER_TODO with candidate annotations REQUIRES RESEARCHER VALIDATION.
- Stopping boundary: Session 3 complete; no experimental condition construction, source rewriting, researcher metadata exposure to pilot/conditions/, public internet access, package/tool/model installation or next-stage work.

## 2026-10-03T16:43:07+06:00 — Clarify Session 3 researcher validation decisions

- Task: explained the outstanding scientific approvals as concrete proposed label/class, decisive evidence, threat-scope and E2/E3 design decisions.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md only.
- Commands/checks: read config/scenario.json; confirmed scenario 24e78349 and three final scientific fields remain RESEARCHER_TODO.
- Findings: prior scenario selection persists; source-level interpretation and exact evidence definition need explicit card approval. Delivery/browser exploitability and actual constructed-workspace E2/E3 validity remain unverified.
- Researcher decisions required: approve/revise the proposed values and scope after reviewing cited evidence. No approval inferred from the clarification question; no scientific fields changed or conditions built.

## 2026-10-03T16:48:34+06:00 — Record researcher approval of all four Session 3 decisions

- Task: recorded direct researcher response “Yeah approve all”; no scientific approval inferred automatically.
- Created files: none. Modified: config/scenario.json; docs/scenario_validation.md; docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md.
- Changes: set validated_label=VULNERABLE and vulnerability_class=Reflected XSS (CWE-79); recorded approved decisive-evidence description/locations, source-level threat model, and E2/E3 omission proposal with explicit human provenance.
- Checks: JSON parse and approved-field assertions; approval/remaining-decision consistency; empty condition/log directories. Benchmark/snapshot data and prior raw results not modified.
- Limits retained: normal Jinja/default skin, already authorized global administrator, successful backends, SameSite=Strict delivery constraint; no browser/deployed exploit or actual E2/E3 workspace certification.
- Remaining decisions: exact initial source/session context and explicit condition inclusion/exclusion manifest; actual condition sufficiency/unavailability and isolation/leakage audit after construction. No next-stage work, condition construction, or experimental run.

## 2026-10-03T16:50:04+06:00 — Check readiness for Session 4

- Task: checked researcher-approved scenario card and next-session entry prerequisites.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md only.
- Commands/checks: parsed config/scenario.json; confirmed explicit approval and VULNERABLE label for 24e78349; checked config/evidence_manifest.json existence; read Session 4 entry instructions.
- Findings: Session 3 approvals are recorded. Evidence manifest is absent; Session 4 directs creation of a template followed by a stop before construction.
- Remaining decisions: exact inclusion/exclusion and initial evidence paths, including neutral session context, require researcher approval of that manifest. Actual conditions require later validation/audit. No next-stage artifact or condition created during this readiness check.

## 2026-10-03T16:51:16+06:00 — Session 4 manifest template

- Task: began Session 4 by reading AGENTS.md and inspecting config/scenario.json and config/evidence_manifest.json; the evidence manifest was absent, so created the required template and stopped before condition construction.
- Created: config/evidence_manifest.json with scenario-linked ID, source snapshot, and target file; E1/E2/E3 include, exclude, and initial-evidence selections remain RESEARCHER_TODO.
- Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append).
- Commands/checks: read AGENTS.md; inspected scenario card and manifest existence; read SESSIONS.md and prior worklog context; parsed/check structure of the new JSON and checked TODO markers; did not run condition tooling or tests.
- Important findings: scenario 24e78349 is recorded, but the scenario card explicitly says final evidence inclusion/exclusion and shared initial evidence remain pending. No condition directories or researcher-facing output manifests were constructed.
- Unresolved issues / researcher decisions: replace all RESEARCHER_TODO placeholders with explicit, mutually consistent E1/E2/E3 path selections, including neutral cookie/session context. E2/E3 scientific validity and post-build isolation still require researcher validation.

## 2026-10-03T16:54:56+06:00 — Verify requested evidence-manifest template

- Task: handled request to create the evidence manifest; found the template already created by the recorded Session 4 step and preserved it.
- Created files: none in this follow-up. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md only.
- Commands/checks: read AGENTS.md, approved scenario card, Session 4 instructions, existing manifest and worklog; parsed JSON; verified scenario/source/target consistency and source target existence; checked E1/E2/E3 keys and all nine RESEARCHER_TODO selection lists; confirmed manifest bytes unchanged and condition directories empty.
- Findings: config/evidence_manifest.json already satisfies the requested template structure for 24e78349. No duplicate, overwrite, condition builder or experimental workspace created.
- Researcher decisions still required: exact include/exclude/initial evidence paths and shared neutral session context. Approved scenario semantics do not finalize those selections. Actual E2/E3 validity and isolation/leakage audit remain pending.

## 2026-10-03T17:04:37+06:00 — Concrete evidence-manifest review proposal

- Task: presented exact pending researcher decisions with arguments and counterarguments; retained previously recorded scenario approval.
- Created: docs/evidence_manifest_review.md. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md only.
- Checks: read AGENTS.md, SESSIONS.md, scenario card, dossier and TODO manifest; inspected numbered source and template imports; verified 19 proposed regular non-symlink files and all excerpt bounds; computed available-source and initial-payload byte totals; SHA-256 confirmed active manifest unchanged; condition directories remain empty.
- Findings: proposed identical 19-file E1/E2 static workspaces, 13-file E3 subset, exact initial excerpts and identical neutral cookie context. Explicitly documented partial-repository, prompt-size, prior-knowledge and omission-cue limits.
- Researcher decisions required: approve/revise all six concrete selection/representation decisions. Actual constructed-workspace sufficiency/unavailability, isolation/leakage and token budget remain later checks.
- Boundary: no active manifest selections finalized, source modified, evidence packets/conditions constructed, package installed or experimental run launched.

## 2026-10-03T18:27:13+06:00 — Record researcher approval and finalize evidence selections

- Task: recorded direct acceptance “Alright approve, then” of the documented construction plan and populated exact selections; no condition construction.
- Created: four exclusive pre-edit backups in private/ground_truth/24e78349_validation/manifest_approval_backups_20261003T182713761202/.
- Modified: config/evidence_manifest.json; config/scenario.json (approval/status notes only); docs/evidence_manifest_review.md; docs/scenario_validation.md (append); docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md.
- Checks: read AGENTS.md, session instructions, review/card/manifest; verified all 271 source files and no symlinks, safe contained relative paths, include/exclude partitions, initial-file membership, excerpt bounds and exact absent-parent cookie exception; JSON parse/no manifest TODOs; E1/E2 file and E2/E3 initial-evidence equality; source SHA-256 unchanged; conditions empty. Initial verification expected 19 supplemental ranges but found 18; corrected the counting assertion before any writes.
- Findings: E1/E2 include 19 and exclude 252 files; E3 includes 13 and excludes 258. E1 supplies 19 excerpts including the cookie line; E2/E3 one each plus three shared full initial files. Accepted partial static repository, prompt-length, omission-cue and prior-knowledge limits retained.
- Remaining validation: actual constructed-workspace sufficiency/retrievability/unavailability and post-build token budget, isolation/leakage review. Plan approval does not certify unbuilt conditions.
- Boundary: no builder, packets, condition copies, experimental runs, model/harness changes or source/dataset changes.

## 2026-10-03T18:35:30+06:00 — Session 4 deterministic condition build

- Task: inspected the now researcher-approved evidence manifest and built E1/E2/E3 condition workspaces, researcher-facing SHA-256 manifests, tests and a mechanical comparison report.
- Created: `scripts/build_conditions.py`; `tests/test_build_conditions.py`; `results/manifests/E1_manifest.json`, `E2_manifest.json`, `E3_manifest.json`; condition source copies beneath `pilot/conditions/E1/`, `E2/`, and `E3/`; `docs/condition_build_report.md`.
- Modified: `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md` (this append). The researcher-provided `config/evidence_manifest.json` and source snapshot were not modified.
- Commands/checks: read AGENTS.md, scenario card, evidence manifest, Session 4 instructions and researcher-facing manifest review; ran `python3 -m unittest tests.test_build_conditions -v` (7 passed); ran builder `--help`; built using explicit `--source` and `--destination` (pre-existing condition directories were inspected and empty before `--force`); ran `python3 -m py_compile scripts/build_conditions.py tests/test_build_conditions.py`; checked exact inventories, source/copy hashes, no symlinks, empty missing-path lists, E1/E2 source equality, E2/E3 packet equality, six E3 omissions, and absence of selected answer markers in agent-visible files.
- Findings: E1/E2 each contain 19 files / 222,188 bytes and share workspace SHA-256 `2b62f306d9ba1da57f9753b23b9b468a2f8a66d34965204a7cf18ce55259a134`; E3 contains 13 files / 141,656 bytes with workspace SHA-256 `8b98cd677fbe1e79ebec12de87ecfa07d9394a83fb513a2ed764c7c8fd37ca16`. E1 initial packet is 40,619 bytes; E2/E3 are 5,499 bytes each. Details and selected file hashes are in `docs/condition_build_report.md` and all file hashes/content packets are in researcher-facing manifests outside the workspaces.
- Warnings / unresolved researcher validation: E1 sufficiency, E2 initial insufficiency/retrievability, E3 unavailability, and actual token fit at 16,384 context remain to be validated. The condition paths are under a repository root with sibling `private/`; ordinary filesystem access can navigate upward to it. Do not start experimental agents until the separate isolation/access-boundary audit resolves this. No model or experimental agent was run.

## 2026-10-03T18:43:51+06:00 — Session 5 leakage checker and workspace audit

- Task: implemented the configurable recursive leakage checker, added test coverage, and audited E1/E2/E3 without changing condition contents.
- Created: `scripts/leakage_check.py`; `config/leakage_rules.json`; `tests/test_leakage_check.py`; `tests/__init__.py` (enables standard unittest discovery); `docs/leakage_audit.md`.
- Modified: `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md` (this append). Condition workspaces and researcher manifests were not modified.
- Commands/checks: read AGENTS.md and Session 5 instructions; ran `python3 -m unittest discover -v` (14 passed); ran Python compilation and parsed `config/leakage_rules.json`; ran `python3 scripts/leakage_check.py pilot/conditions/E1 --json`, and the equivalent E2/E3 commands (each exit 0, with 0 findings and 0 audit errors).
- Findings: no symlinks, symlink escapes, CVE/CWE identifiers, forbidden path/name tokens, Git metadata, patch/diff artifacts or answer markers were found. No allowlist exceptions were needed in the real workspaces; a fixture test confirms a documented allowed literal is reported separately without failing the audit. No suspicious content was deleted.
- Unresolved warnings / researcher validation: the recursive scan does not sandbox ancestor access; condition paths remain under a repository tree with sibling `private/`, reachable by ordinary parent traversal. Do not start experimental agents until that access boundary is resolved. E1/E2/E3 scientific validity and the required-context token budget remain unverified and require researcher validation.

## 2026-10-03T18:56:57+06:00 — Session 6 prompt and runner prepared; runs blocked

- Task: read AGENTS.md and Session 6; inspected the smoke-test placeholder, environment inventory, installed Qwen CLI help/version, local Qwen model/provider settings, Ollama client/server availability, and Qwen sandbox status. Created the frozen prompt and guarded runner, then prepared a mechanical run-status summary.
- Created: `prompts/common_prompt.txt` (SHA-256 `107dca240cf64f0ac4c4dc56f61ec976f5174db5da6dcb60ca20a3a2dff509a1`); `scripts/run_pilot.py`; `docs/qwen_run_summary.md`.
- Modified: `docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md` (this append). No harness settings or condition contents were changed. No run directory or raw Qwen log was created.
- Commands/checks: `qwen --help`; `qwen --version` (0.24.6); `ollama --version` (client 0.32.14); `curl --silent --show-error --max-time 2 http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/version` (connection refused); `qwen sandbox --verify` (no execution sandbox configured); `python3 -m py_compile scripts/run_pilot.py`; `python3 scripts/run_pilot.py --help`; verified local Qwen settings select the required model and endpoint without printing credentials; verified prompt composition for all conditions and unique non-resumed session IDs; directly verified the runner's private-ancestor guard rejects E1.
- Findings: no known-good Qwen invocation is recorded; the runner uses the installed CLI's documented one-shot/session flags and checks the local provider settings. E1/E2/E3 condition roots have the repository root as an ancestor, where sibling `private/` is reachable by ordinary parent traversal. The CLI reports no configured OS sandbox, so the runner rejects launch. Ollama's server version endpoint is also unavailable from this execution environment.
- Researcher decision / unresolved issues: no Qwen experimental process was started, and no rerun was attempted. Resolve a filesystem boundary that denies `private/` while preserving the approved condition contents and exact condition cwd, and make the required Ollama server endpoint reachable to the execution environment before launching the three runs. Run summary records all three as not launched; no scientific conclusions drawn.

## 2026-10-03T19:50:07+06:00 — Session 6 launch repair and Qwen E1/E2/E3 execution

- Task: resolved the previously recorded unlaunched status, then executed only Qwen Code on E1, E2 and E3 with fresh session IDs; no OpenCode runs or scientific scoring. Historical blocked entry retained.
- Created: scripts/qwen_isolation.py; tests/test_qwen_isolation.py; raw experiment directories and infrastructure-check artifacts under logs/raw/qwen/; isolated per-run runtime homes under the host temporary directory.
- Modified: scripts/run_pilot.py; docs/qwen_run_summary.md; docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md. Pre-edit runner and blocked summary preserved in private/ground_truth/24e78349_validation/session6_fix_backups_20261003T190617494314/. Prompt, approved condition sources and model/harness user settings retained.
- Infrastructure repair: host execution reached Ollama where Codex sandbox loopback could not. Verified native macOS confinement denies researcher config/private contents, parent directory listing, other-condition reads and condition writes while allowing target reads and runtime writes. Initial default-deny profiles failed runtime startup; working profiles deny user/temp contents except the exact condition, isolated runtime home and Node installation, deny writes except runtime files, and allow only local Ollama outbound traffic. Failed confinement probes occurred before any model session; artifacts retained. Safe mode disables custom contexts/hooks/extensions/skills/MCP; explicit supported exclusions prevent non-read-only tools.
- Preserved infrastructure attempt: E1 8aac3bce-4b75-43d4-ae58-9c8cbdc7654f exited 1 after 0.640047 seconds, with empty stdout and a missing-input CLI error. Explicit --prompt delivery corrected the consumed positional argument. Its fresh-session retry is linked in metadata; original failed logs unchanged. No rerun based on a verdict or reasoning.
- Completed E1: run 8c6debaf-d318-4515-9177-6147554ed4ed, exit 0, runtime 387.237063 seconds, 1 unique observable tool requests; raw logs logs/raw/qwen/20261003T131320Z_E1_8c6debaf-d318-4515-9177-6147554ed4ed/.
- Completed E2: run 2835b0b8-324c-47d6-acc9-76b329e44a84, exit 0, runtime 617.546533 seconds, 4 unique observable tool requests; raw logs logs/raw/qwen/20261003T132047Z_E2_2835b0b8-324c-47d6-acc9-76b329e44a84/.
- Completed E3: run fd7cee9c-2841-4cd1-96c1-c0ed4205a895, exit 0, runtime 941.467322 seconds, 17 unique observable tool requests; raw logs logs/raw/qwen/20261003T133157Z_E3_fd7cee9c-2841-4cd1-96c1-c0ed4205a895/.
- Commands/checks: installed CLI help/source for supported flags/tool names; host Ollama version/model inventory/server context environment and loaded-model context; python3 scripts/run_pilot.py --harness qwen --condition E1/E2/E3 --scenario-id 24e78349 (E1 retry additionally records --retry-of and infrastructure reason); leakage checks before every process; python3 -m unittest tests.test_qwen_isolation tests.test_build_conditions tests.test_leakage_check (17 passing); py_compile; JSON/event/final-answer extraction consistency; approved condition SHA-256 and original included-source hashes; E2/E3 identical full prompt bytes; frozen common-prompt hash unchanged.
- Mechanical findings: all three completed Qwen processes exited 0; each used Qwen 0.24.6, qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M, endpoint http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 and context 16384 in both run environment and running server. Loaded context 16384 captured for each. Startup advertised read_file, grep_search and glob. E1 trace includes an internal provider retry; preserved without restarting the session. E3 shell requests were denied by harness policy; denied requests remain included in observable-request counts. All condition files unchanged.
- Remaining work: researcher scientific assessment remains pending; this session makes no claims about verdict correctness, evidence sufficiency, acquisition quality or explanation grounding. Input/output usage and internal retry events remain available in raw traces for later review. No scoring, log normalization, OpenCode execution or next-stage work performed.
- Final report inspection: added glob-pattern extraction and a supplemental mechanical_paths.json for E3 (nine distinct selectors) without changing any completed run metadata, stdout or stderr; targeted extractor tests pass. Summary includes all observed read paths, glob selectors and the denied shell search request.

## 2026-10-03T23:04:10+06:00 — Session 7 OpenCode E1/E2/E3 execution

- Task: read AGENTS.md and Session 7, inspected recorded OpenCode smoke-test material, user configuration, prior native logs, installed CLI help/version and matching local SDK schemas. Executed exactly one fresh OpenCode process for each approved condition; no separate experimental rerun or scientific assessment.
- Invocation provenance: config/harness_commands.example.sh still contains placeholders. Existing OpenCode logs identify the required Ollama model but contain no exact known-good invocation. Used installed 1.18.30 documented one-shot JSON flags: opencode --pure run --model ollama/qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M --format json --port <isolated_ephemeral_control_port> -- <frozen_condition_prompt>. No continue/session/attach/resume flags. The control port only supports native local transport confinement.
- Created: scripts/opencode_pilot.py; scripts/opencode_events.py; tests/test_opencode_pilot.py; tests/test_opencode_events.py; docs/opencode_run_summary.md; exclusive raw run and preflight directories under logs/raw/opencode/; logs/raw/opencode/session7_integrity_checks.json; isolated per-run runtime homes in the host temporary directory. Preserved pre-edit shared runner in private/ground_truth/24e78349_validation/session7_backups_20261003T210052878612/.
- Modified: scripts/run_pilot.py (OpenCode harness choice and adapter dispatch; existing Qwen execution branch retained); docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append). Frozen prompt, source snapshots, approved condition contents, researcher scenario/evidence metadata and user harness/model settings were not edited.
- Isolation: reused the native macOS filesystem confinement helper with the exact OpenCode installation allowed for startup and a single ephemeral native control port. Boundary probes denied private/config ground truth, ancestor listing, other-condition reads and workspace writes; allowed target reads, isolated-home writes and host Ollama. Fresh HOME/XDG storage for each run; no inherited sessions or external plugins. Isolated runtime configuration binds both primary and auxiliary model requests to the locked model/endpoint and allows only read/glob/grep/list tools. No generation, timeout, reasoning, token-limit or retry-policy tuning.
- Reproducibility: each process used OpenCode 1.18.30, qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M, http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1, OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384. Server environment and loaded-model context 16384 captured for all three. Full stdout/stderr, resolved runtime configuration, prompt bytes, per-run metadata, observable tool events, native logs and native stored message/part records retained.
- Delegation: a bounded Luna Low scout inspected local invocation provenance; a bounded Luna Medium worker implemented the mechanical JSON event extractor and focused tests. Lead reviewed implementation, raw event structures and extraction consistency; no research judgments delegated.
- E1: run 3bbecc73-4acc-4484-a252-2c5fa241c705; native session ses_efdb300d1ffevTY7U1RIRX0Nt0; exit 0; recorded monotonic runtime 840.050178 seconds; UTC timestamp interval 840.041 seconds; 0 unique observable tool calls; output logs/raw/opencode/20261003T150600Z_E1_3bbecc73-4acc-4484-a252-2c5fa241c705/. Final text present.
- E2: run a853ff77-5b1d-49cc-9889-6d128d271710; native session ses_efda4cb24ffeepb8QQO81VSIZd; exit 0; recorded monotonic runtime 461.041258 seconds; UTC timestamp interval 3527.982 seconds; 3 unique observable tool calls; output logs/raw/opencode/20261003T152131Z_E2_a853ff77-5b1d-49cc-9889-6d128d271710/. Final text absent.
- E3: run dd798e58-fca8-4a10-9c40-652b09426a37; native session ses_efd6e91a8ffeAAPTOwuFG4o9qB; exit 0; recorded monotonic runtime 1470.930320 seconds; UTC timestamp interval 2410.541 seconds; 0 unique observable tool calls; output logs/raw/opencode/20261003T162043Z_E3_dd798e58-fca8-4a10-9c40-652b09426a37/. Final text present.
- Mechanical anomalies preserved: E1/E2/E3 native logs contain 1/1/4 provider-header timeout events, respectively, with internal retries in the original sessions. Failed models-catalogue and background plugin-package fetches logged DNS errors. E2 exits 0 and emits a stop event without a final text part; native message records independently confirm no final text. No answer was invented or rerun for this output. E2/E3 monotonic runtime differs from UTC timestamp interval; both measurements retained and cause unestablished.
- Commands/checks: python3 scripts/run_pilot.py --harness opencode --condition E1/E2/E3 --scenario-id 24e78349; confined native debug-config and filesystem boundary checks; host Ollama version/context/loaded-model queries; python3 -m unittest tests.test_opencode_pilot tests.test_opencode_events tests.test_qwen_isolation tests.test_build_conditions tests.test_leakage_check (25 passed); py_compile during implementation; shared-runner diff inspected against backup; raw JSON extractor consistency, native final-message part types and exact final-text extraction inspected.
- Final integrity: common prompt SHA-256 remains 107dca240cf64f0ac4c4dc56f61ec976f5174db5da6dcb60ca20a3a2dff509a1. All condition files match approved manifest hashes before/after. Complete prompts exactly match corresponding completed Qwen runs; E2/E3 prompt bytes identical. Three distinct fresh native session IDs. Existing raw Qwen runs preserved.
- Remaining decisions: researcher assessment of outputs, evidence acquisition, grounding and abstention remains pending. Timing discrepancy cause and output absence are documented mechanical observations. No verdict normalization, scoring, scientific conclusions, cross-harness analysis or next-session work performed. Session 7 stops here.

## 2026-10-03T23:26:55+06:00 — Authorized OpenCode E2 infrastructure retry

- Task: researcher authorized one E2 retry after reporting laptop closure. Read AGENTS.md, existing runner/adapter, recorded invocation and original metadata; confirmed overlapping idle/clamshell sleep using pmset logs before launching. The missing-final-answer cause remains unestablished; no retry based on correctness or explanation quality.
- Executed: /usr/bin/caffeinate -i -s python3 scripts/run_pilot.py --harness opencode --condition E2 --scenario-id 24e78349 --retry-of a853ff77-5b1d-49cc-9889-6d128d271710 --infrastructure-reason '<confirmed sleep overlap and direct researcher authorization>'. Used recorded runner command, locked model/endpoint/context, identical frozen prompt and condition files, and a fresh isolated runtime home/session. Temporary wrapper prevents idle sleep during execution; no persistent power/harness/model settings changed.
- Created: logs/raw/opencode/20261003T171115Z_E2_4584631b-9ad7-4e1c-8a04-a3b699e3706c/ with raw stdout/stderr, prompt, run metadata, observable events, verbatim final text, native log/message records, loaded context, sleep assertions and retry_integrity_checks.json; logs/raw/opencode/infrastructure_retry_diagnosis_20261003T171109Z/diagnosis.json and pre-edit summary backup. No source or script changes.
- Modified: docs/opencode_run_summary.md (added retry as a separate attempt); docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append). Existing raw runs, frozen prompt, benchmark source, condition files and configuration retained.
- Mechanical outcome: run 4584631b-9ad7-4e1c-8a04-a3b699e3706c; native session ses_efd40555fffeNFjIWLVO26dun7; exit 0; monotonic runtime 819.290123 seconds; UTC interval 819.276 seconds; 5 observable tool calls; final text at stdout.txt line 15 and final_answer.txt. One provider-header timeout and same-session internal retry preserved. No sleep/wake events recorded during the retry. No additional attempt launched.
- Checks: installed-version/model/server-context and confinement preflights passed; loaded model context 16384 captured; prompt/runtime configuration identical to original; distinct fresh session ID; approved E2 workspace hashes match before/after; exact tool/final-text extraction verified; original raw file SHA-256 baseline unchanged. No code changes required new unit tests.
- Researcher decisions remaining: interpretation and handling of both E2 attempts in analysis require researcher validation. No scientific scoring, source changes, E1/E3 reruns or next-stage work performed.

## 2026-10-04T00:04:23+06:00 — Session 8 normalization and researcher scoring worksheet

- Task: read AGENTS.md, relevant run summaries, recorded attempts, approved manifests and source evidence; normalized the six pilot slots without launching any experimental process or changing raw logs.
- Created: scripts/normalize_logs.py; tests/test_normalize_logs.py; four fixture logs under tests/fixtures/normalization/; logs/normalized/index.json and eight attempt directories containing records, observable traces, exact stdout/stderr copies and final-answer copies where present; results/pilot_results_draft.csv; results/pilot_attempts.csv; results/pilot_candidate_assessments.csv; docs/pilot_scoring_worksheet.md. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append).
- Attempt policy: six draft rows select the terminal attempt in each explicit retry_of chain, independently of output quality. All eight attempts remain normalized and listed separately. Retry inclusion requires researcher validation; earlier attempts are not silently excluded scientifically.
- Extraction: preserved original verdict wording and final text, conservative normalized labels, unique observable tool requests including denied calls, requested paths/search patterns, raw-line citations, recorded runtimes and separate UTC timing discrepancies. Missing final answers remain absent. Ambiguous target-security verdicts remain UNPARSEABLE.
- Review material: all seven judgment fields and three candidate fields in the draft/all-attempt CSVs are blank. Twelve provisional assessments are separate, each with evidence citations, confidence and REQUIRES RESEARCHER VALIDATION. Worksheet includes final answers, searches, reads, candidate acquisition moments and unsupported statements, source evidence for review, and blank scoring tables. No rankings or harness-superiority claims.
- Delegation: bounded Luna Medium worker implemented the mechanical parser and initial fixture tests; lead reviewed and repaired parsing, retry selection, filesystem protection and tests, inspected source/trace evidence, and prepared the researcher worksheet. Scientific interpretation was not delegated as ground truth.
- Commands/tests: python3 scripts/normalize_logs.py --scenario-id 24e78349; python3 -m unittest tests.test_normalize_logs tests.test_opencode_events (15 passed). Additional integrity checks verified all 113 raw-file SHA-256 values and inventory unchanged, six draft/eight attempt rows, exact raw-text copies, blank researcher fields, raw-line references and worksheet links, normalizer hash provenance, and all approved condition hashes unchanged.
- Remaining decisions: researcher must review attempt inclusion and manually score recognition, retrieval, abstention, final behavior, grounding and unsupported claims. Candidate assessments are proposals only. No new runs, configuration changes, final scientific scores or next-stage work performed. Session 8 stops here.

## 2026-10-04T21:15:32+06:00 — Researcher-requested methodology and architecture assets

- Task: prepared a manuscript-style methodology explanation and publication-oriented methodology/execution diagrams before researcher scoring; this request does not initiate the remaining Session 9 trace selection or any new experiment. Read AGENTS.md, SESSIONS.md, current scenario/evidence/build/scoring records and relevant runner code.
- Created: docs/methodology.md; scripts/render_methodology_figures.py; docs/figures/pilot_methodology.pdf/.svg/.png; docs/figures/pilot_architecture.pdf/.svg/.png; docs/figures/figure_manifest.json. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append).
- Content: documented the single-case six-cell pilot, invariant target, identical E1/E2 source and E2/E3 initial packets, bounded source-level threat model, private reference boundary, fresh harness sessions with a shared model/context, raw trace normalization, proposed manual scoring, retained infrastructure attempts and threats to validity. Explicitly distinguished design intent from scientific condition validity and configured context from proven token/attention equivalence.
- Delegation: one read-only Luna Low worker collected execution facts and source citations; lead verified relevant runner/source records and handled methodology interpretation and final integration.
- Figure tools: bundled ReportLab and Poppler; no package installation, internet access, experimental process or harness/model-setting change. Exported editable SVG, text-searchable vector PDF and 216-DPI PNG; recorded renderer/output SHA-256 hashes. Visual inspection of both rendered figures completed, with boundary and connector layout corrected before final inspection.
- Commands/checks: bundled Python scripts/render_methodology_figures.py; regeneration to a task-owned temporary output directory for layout correction; python3 -m py_compile scripts/render_methodology_figures.py; renderer --help; existing-output refusal checked (exit 1, intended); PDF page dimensions/text extraction, SVG XML parsing, document-link checks and provenance hash verification. Checked all 7,984 protected file hashes (raw/normalized logs, snapshots, conditions, frozen prompt, scenario/evidence configuration and scoring CSVs): unchanged.
- Findings/limits: eight attempts preserved for six draft cells; no stochastic replication, randomization/counterbalancing, browser exploit validation, independent raters or final scientific scoring. Diagram sufficiency/unavailability labels reflect the approved construction intent.
- Researcher decisions remaining: validate scientific condition interpretation, attempt inclusion and score-field definitions/applicability; manually assess traces and explanations. Scores remain blank. No next research stage started.

## 2026-10-04T21:34:30+06:00 — Browser reference and DREA-inspired pilot diagram

- Task: inspected the researcher's open Chrome tab showing DREA/figures/fig2_DREA.png using native browser accessibility and screenshot tools, then created another diagram matching its pastel panels, serif typography, retrieval loop and evaluation layout.
- Created: scripts/render_drea_style_diagram.py; docs/drea_style_diagram.md (caption, attribution and reproduction instructions); docs/figures/pilot_drea_style.pdf/.svg/.png; docs/figures/pilot_drea_style_manifest.json. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append). Earlier methodology diagrams and manuscript preserved.
- Adaptation: depicts one Qwen Code OR OpenCode session with the shared 9B model and configured 16K context; controlled E1/E2/E3 inputs; optional read-only evidence loop; final assessment; manual evaluation of all six cells. Private paired source/label/patch/scoring reference feeds researcher evaluation only. No separate planner/explorer models, true-positive-only scoring, hidden reasoning, scientific scores or superiority claims introduced.
- Commands/checks: bundled Python scripts/render_drea_style_diagram.py; task-owned temporary regeneration for spacing corrections; python3 -m py_compile scripts/render_drea_style_diagram.py; intended existing-output refusal (exit 1); final PNG visually inspected; SVG XML and document links checked; one-page PDF dimensions/text and embedded regular/bold Times New Roman fonts verified; renderer/output hashes verified. All 7,984 protected hashes and earlier figure hashes unchanged.
- Researcher decisions pending: scientific condition interpretation, attempt inclusion and manual scoring remain pending. No experiment, configuration change, model request, package installation or next-stage scoring performed.

## 2026-10-04T21:40:42+06:00 — Generalize evaluation labels in the presentation diagram

- Task: renamed visible Researcher Evaluation to Human Evaluation and Private Researcher Reference to Private Evaluation Reference; changed the access label accordingly. Replaced the pilot-status message about pending judgments with Trace-grounded human scoring. Explained Log.GET as the unchanged case-specific unit of analysis.
- Modified: scripts/render_drea_style_diagram.py; docs/drea_style_diagram.md; docs/figures/pilot_drea_style.pdf/.svg/.png and its provenance manifest; docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append). Previous presentation artifacts preserved in a task-owned temporary backup; earlier methodology figures untouched.
- Checks: regenerated using bundled ReportLab/Poppler in a fresh temporary output directory; final PNG visually inspected; PDF text confirms generalized labels and no pending-status note; SVG XML and renderer/export hashes verified. All 7,984 protected hashes unchanged; six draft rows still have blank manual scoring fields. No new tests needed for these wording changes.
- Remaining decisions: actual scientific scoring remains pending in the scoring artifacts. Removing a status label from the diagram does not approve scores, evidence validity or results. No experimental execution or configuration change.


## 2026-10-04T21:49:42+06:00 — DREA paper reading and proposed study positioning

- Task: read DREA's methodology, experimental setup, results, discussion and limitations; verified acceptance against the official Internetware 2026 Research Track paper listing; compared the published protocol against docs/methodology.md.
- Sources: https://arxiv.org/html/2607.13439v1 ; https://conf.researchr.org/details/internetware-2026/internetware-2026-research-track/42/DREA-Decoupled-Reasoning-and-Exploration-Agents-for-Repository-Level-Vulnerability-D . Relevant comparisons: Sections 3.1, 3.3, 4.1, 4.3 and 6.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append only). No experimental materials, raw logs, scoring records, configuration or research conclusions changed.
- Checks: primary-source web reading and comparison with current local methodology; no code changes requiring tests.
- Findings: DREA already includes context/tool baselines, reasoning correctness evaluation and human validation of its judge. Its published detector returns binary verdicts; reasoning correctness scoring concerns true positives. Proposed distinction is selective evidence availability, explicit insufficient-evidence behavior, and checking explanations against initial materials and observable acquisition traces across outcomes.
- Researcher decisions remaining: proposed contribution and positioning require researcher validation and broader related-work review; six pilot cells do not establish general harness superiority or population-level effects. No next experimental or scoring stage started.


## 2026-10-04T22:43:26+06:00 — Verify DREA judge identity

- Task/check: verified Sections 3.3 and 4.3 of https://arxiv.org/html/2607.13439v1 against the primary paper. GPT-4.1 judges reasoning correctness on true positives; two experienced security researchers independently validate 50 sampled judgments.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append). No code tests applicable. No scientific scoring or experimental stage performed; existing researcher decisions remain pending.


## 2026-10-05T18:13:28+06:00 — Public GitHub preparation and ignore policy

- Task: read AGENTS.md; inventoried files, sizes and relevant configuration/documentation; researcher confirmed public GitHub intent. Existing directory organization retained; no Git initialization, staging, remote creation or push.
- Created: .gitignore; README.md; docs/github_preparation.md. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append only). No file moves, data deletion or configuration edits.
- Upload policy: exclude private snapshots/reference archive, downloaded RepoPairBench data, generated conditions, raw/normalized logs, draft CSV/TSV/XLSX exports, credentials and machine caches. Keep implementation, test fixtures, frozen prompt, researcher configuration, condition manifests, docs and figure exports. Ignoring does not remove local evidence or enforce agent isolation.
- Checks: path-only credential-pattern scan of 264 text files found no matches (limited scan); Git check-ignore in a temporary repository passed 34 inclusion/exclusion assertions; full current inventory yielded 65 includable files around 2.1 MB and 8,011 ignored files; README relative links passed. PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests: 34 passed. SHA-256 baseline preservation verified for pre-existing files other than the required worklog append.
- Findings/remaining decisions: private/ holds 7,787 files and 299,546,963 bytes. No root Git metadata, README or project license existed. Choose a license and review public research disclosure; historical docs contain machine-specific links/paths and some earlier-session setup states. Scientific scores and experimental stages remain unchanged.


## 2026-10-05T18:21:13+06:00 — EVIS naming collision check

- Task: searched public research publications and GitHub for EVIS, its proposed expansion, and security/vulnerability/agentic uses; verified primary arXiv and GitHub matches.
- Findings: EVIS already names an event-camera simulation project (https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.08098), a video-segmentation assistant (https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26994), and EViS virtual-screening software (https://github.com/JingHuangLab/EViS). No direct agentic-vulnerability-detection naming collision surfaced in this limited search; uniqueness or legal availability is not established.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (append only). No project rename, Git initialization, remote creation, experiment, or configuration change. Checks: web searches and primary-source opens; no code tests applicable.
- Researcher decision: retain EVIS with a descriptive repository suffix or choose another name; no final name assigned by Codex.


## 2026-10-05T18:23:58+06:00 — EAGER naming collision check

- Task: searched EAGER and the proposed expansion in public research/GitHub, focusing on explanations, grounding, agent exploration and security. Verified author/lab and conference sources.
- Findings: EAGER already names Explainable question answering using knowledge graphs (2023; https://hcmi.ee.torontomu.ca/publication/eager-explainable-question-answering-using-knowledge-graphs/); a NeurIPS 2022 Main Conference Track language-guided RL method with grounding/exploration in its expansion (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/50eb39ab717507cccbe2b8590de32030-Abstract-Conference.html ; https://github.com/flowersteam/EAGER); and EAGer, Entropy-Aware GEneRation for Adaptive Inference-Time Scaling (https://github.com/DanielSc4/EAGer). These neighboring AI uses reduce distinctiveness of the standalone name.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (append only). Checks: web searches and primary-source opens; no code tests applicable. No name adoption, project rename, Git operation, configuration change, or experiment performed.
- Researcher decision remaining: project name; the search does not establish exhaustive or legal name availability.


## 2026-10-05T18:30:04+06:00 — Aegis naming collision check

- Task: searched Aegis/AEGIS in public security research and GitHub, including vulnerability reasoning, agent auditing and explanations. Verified primary arXiv abstracts and an author-maintained repository.
- Findings: direct topic collision with AEGIS: From Clues to Verdicts -- Graph-Guided Deep Vulnerability Reasoning via Dialectics and Meta-Auditing (https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.20637), which describes evidence-grounded vulnerability reasoning and trace-based claim auditing; separate AEGIS AI-agent firewall/audit research (https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.12621); and Aegis LLM firewall software (https://github.com/automorphic-ai/aegis). Recommend avoiding this crowded name. The first paper is a potential related-work item; only its abstract was inspected during this naming task, not a full scientific comparison.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (append only). Checks: web searches and primary-source opens; no code tests applicable. No project rename, Git operation, configuration change, experiment, or scientific score.
- Researcher decision remaining: project name. No claim of exhaustive or legal name availability.


## 2026-10-05T18:34:18+06:00 — AVEX and Vulnex naming checks

- Task: searched both proposed names in research publications and GitHub, focusing on agentic AI, vulnerability analysis and explanations; inspected primary research abstracts and repository pages.
- Findings: VulnEx is already a vulnerability-exploration research project (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06259 ; https://github.com/dbvis-ukon/vulnex), and VULNEX is an existing cybersecurity organization (https://github.com/vulnex). AVEX has unrelated/neighboring AI uses: Animal Vocalization Encoder Library (https://github.com/earthspecies/avex), AVEX-Prune audio-visual captioning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.10533), and AVEX AI Lab. No direct agentic-vulnerability-explanation match surfaced in this limited search. Proposed preference between these two is AVEX with its expansion and a descriptive subtitle; global uniqueness is not established.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (append only). Checks: web searches and primary-source opens; no code tests applicable. No final name, project rename, Git operation, configuration change or experiment.
- Researcher decision remaining: choose the project name; no exhaustive or legal availability claim.


## 2026-10-05T18:39:39+06:00 — Adopt AVEX and rename local repository

- Task: researcher selected AVEX (Agentic Vulnerability EXplanations); renamed /Users/shazzad/Desktop/Codespace/evis to /Users/shazzad/Desktop/Codespace/avex. Existing Git repository and all ignored research artifacts moved intact. No Git remote was configured, so no hosted repository rename was applicable.
- Created: none. Modified: README.md; AGENTS.md (project name/title only); docs/methodology.md; docs/drea_style_diagram.md; docs/github_preparation.md; docs/qwen_run_summary.md; docs/opencode_run_summary.md; docs/pilot_scoring_worksheet.md; docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append). Made 207 documentation links relative, retaining source-line anchors; historical tool arguments, run paths, manifests and raw records retain original provenance.
- Checks: 212 local documentation links resolved before move; PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests passed all 34 tests before and after move. SHA-256 baseline verified all 8,076 pre-existing files retained and protected contents unchanged except requested documentation edits. Git index hash unchanged; existing staging preserved.
- Findings: no active script/test/configuration reference required a path rewrite; scripts resolve the project dynamically. No prompt, condition, dataset, source snapshot, raw/normalized log, score, figure export or experimental configuration changed. No experiment, commit, stage, remote creation or push.
- Remaining actions: reopen the renamed avex directory in Codex and re-stage updated docs before committing; licensing/public-disclosure review and scientific scoring remain separate pending decisions.


## 2026-10-05T18:45:11+06:00 — RUNE naming check; conditional rename not performed

- Task: researcher requested checking RUNE and adopting it only if the result was positive. Searched security/AI/explanation uses and verified primary project pages.
- Findings: particularly close collision with Rune by the Colour Foundation (https://github.com/thecolourfoundation/rune), a read-only repository-evidence tool that generates model explanations and checks statements against retrieved source citations. Additional overlaps include Rune runtime security for AI agents (https://runesec.dev/), a terminal coding agent (https://github.com/khang859/rune), encrypted AI-agent memory and Google's security-oriented programming language. The check does not support a positive distinctiveness recommendation.
- Created: none. Modified: docs/CODEX_WORKLOG.md (this append only). AVEX project name, folder and references retained under the user's conditional instruction. No model request, experiment, Git operation or configuration change. Checks: web searches, primary-source opens and current project-title check; no code tests applicable.
- Researcher decision remaining: retain AVEX or choose another name; no exhaustive/legal availability claim and no scientific comparison with the newly found tool performed.


### 2026-10-05T18:54:37+06:00 — Initial Git commit and GitHub push attempt

- Task: diagnose and fix the requested GitHub publication error; attempt an authorized push to `origin` (`https://github.com/shazzad5709/avex.git`).
- Files created: none. Files modified: this worklog; Git index/history updated to include the existing approved AVEX files and latest documentation changes.
- Checks/commands: tracked-path and symlink inventory; commit identity check; `git diff --check`; `git diff --cached --check`; `git ls-remote origin`; `git add` restricted to the 65 already tracked paths; `git commit -m "Initialize AVEX research pilot"`; `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git push -u origin main`; credential-helper inspection; read-only SSH remote/identity availability checks.
- Findings: `main` initially had no commits, and the remote advertised no refs. Created initial commit `ce467fb`. The tracked inventory contained 65 files totaling 2,072,905 bytes, with no tracked source snapshots, condition workspaces, run logs, result spreadsheets, or symlinks. The unstaged diff check passed; the staged baseline check reported existing Markdown hard-break whitespace and PDF-format whitespace, which were preserved. No implementation changes or experimental runs were made.
- Push outcome: GitHub HTTPS push failed with `could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled`. The configured helper is `osxkeychain`; no usable HTTPS credentials were supplied. SSH verification found no trusted GitHub host key; no default SSH key or available agent identities were found, and `gh` is unavailable. Remote and authentication configuration were preserved.
- Unresolved: the repository owner must authenticate GitHub before the first push can finish. No new scientific decisions were made; researcher scoring remains separate from publication.
